# 🔄 Simple Restart Instructions

## I've Fixed the Code! ✅

I've updated your API routes to prevent the Internal Server Error. Now you just need to restart the server.

## 📝 What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Stop the Server
- Look at your terminal (where you see Next.js running)
- Press: **`Ctrl + C`** (or **`Cmd + C`** on Mac)

### Step 2: Start It Again
- In the same terminal, type:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

### Step 3: Wait
- Wait for it to say: **"Ready on http://localhost:3000"**

### Step 4: Test
- Open: http://localhost:3000

## ✅ Done!

The fixes I made should prevent the error. After restart, your app should work!

---

**That's all you need to do!** Just stop (Ctrl+C) and start (npm run dev) the server.
