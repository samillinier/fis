**[SCREENSHOT: Table columns]**

"This table shows eight key metrics for each workroom:

**Store Mix** - Number of stores served and coverage rating (Excellent/Good/Moderate/Low). More stores typically means better distribution.

**LTR Performance** - Customer satisfaction scores with color-coded ratings. Green means excellent, yellow is moderate, red needs attention.

**Labor PO Volume** - Total labor spending and percentage of your total labor budget. Shows which workrooms consume the most resources.

**Vendor Debit Exposure** - Vendor charges and credits. Negative numbers in green are actually good - those are credits! Red indicates high exposure.

**Weighted Score** - The overall WPI performance score. Higher is better, with green bars showing top performers.

**Operational Risks** - Identified issues like limited store coverage, low record volume, or high costs per store. Green checkmark means no risks.

**Financial Risk Rating** - Overall risk level: Low (green), Moderate (yellow), High (orange), or Critical (red).

**Fix This Now** - Actionable recommendations for workrooms needing improvement. Green checkmark means no critical issues.

**[SCREENSHOT: Example row]**

"Use this table to quickly identify:
- Which workrooms are performing well (green indicators)

## TOP PERFORMING WORKROOMS - DETAILED TUTORIAL (5:30 - 7:00)

**[SCREENSHOT: Top Performing Workrooms table]**

"Let's dive into the **Top Performing Workrooms** section. This is one of the most important analytics tools in the dashboard.

**[SCREENSHOT: Table header]**

"This table ranks all your workrooms based on their **Workroom Performance Index**, or WPI score. The workroom with the highest WPI score is ranked number one, and so on.

**[SCREENSHOT: Column headers]**

"Each row shows seven key metrics:

**Rank** - The workroom's position from best to worst performer. Number one is your top performer.

**Workroom** - The name of the workroom location, like Tampa, Sarasota, or Naples.

**Stores** - How many different stores this workroom serves. More stores often means better coverage and distribution.

**LTR%** - Labor-to-Revenue percentage. This shows what percentage of sales goes to labor costs. Lower is better - you want this number to be as low as possible. Green badges indicate excellent performance, yellow means moderate, and red means high labor costs relative to revenue.

**Labor PO $** - The total dollar amount spent on labor for this workroom. This is your labor cost.

**Vendor Debits** - Charges from vendors. Notice that negative numbers are actually good - those are vendor credits or refunds! Green negative numbers mean you're getting money back.

**WPI Score** - The Workroom Performance Index, a weighted score from 0 to 100. Higher is better. This single number combines multiple factors to give you an overall performance rating.

**[SCREENSHOT: Top ranked workrooms]**

"Looking at the top performers, you can see:
- Workrooms with high WPI scores, often 80 or above
- Low LTR percentages, meaning efficient labor usage
- Good store coverage
- Favorable vendor debit situations

**[SCREENSHOT: Color coding]**

"Notice the color coding:
- **Green badges** indicate excellent performance
- **Yellow badges** show moderate performance
- **Red or orange badges** highlight areas needing attention

"Now let's explore **Workrooms Most Responsible for Moving Your Business**. This section shows you which workrooms are driving your business forward in terms of labor volume.

**[SCREENSHOT: Pie chart]**

"At the top, you'll see a colorful pie chart showing the **Labor PO Dollar Distribution** for your top 4 workrooms. Each slice represents one workroom's share of total labor spending.

The chart uses different colors:
- Blue for the largest contributor
- Green for the second largest
- Orange for the third
- Red for the fourth

**[SCREENSHOT: Pie chart with percentages]**

"Each slice shows:
- The workroom name
- The dollar amount in Labor PO spending
- The percentage of total labor spending

For example, if Sarasota shows 34.2%, that means Sarasota accounts for over one-third of your total labor spending across all workrooms.

**[SCREENSHOT: Table below pie chart]**

"Below the pie chart, you'll find a detailed table breaking down the top 4 workrooms:

**WORKROOM** - The workroom name

**AVG LABOR PO $** - The average Labor PO dollar amount per record. This tells you the typical labor cost per job.

**RECORDS** - The number of jobs or records for this workroom. More records means more activity.

**[SCREENSHOT: Interpreting the data]**

"This section helps you understand:
- **Which workrooms are your biggest labor spenders** - These are critical to your business operations
- **Where your labor dollars are concentrated** - Helps with resource planning
- **Workroom activity levels** - More records means more jobs completed
- **Average costs per job** - Compare across workrooms to identify efficiency opportunities

**[SCREENSHOT: Business insights]**

"Key insights you can gain:
- If one workroom has a large slice but high average costs, you might want to investigate efficiency opportunities
- Workrooms with many records but small slices might be more efficient - learn from them
- The top 4 workrooms combined typically represent a significant portion of your total labor spending

This visualization makes it easy to see at a glance which workrooms are most critical to your business operations and where your labor investment is concentrated."
