**What does it show?**

### ✅ If it shows: `"connected": true` and all tables exist
→ Database is connected! Skip to Step 2

### ❌ If it shows: `"missingTables": ["users", "workroom_data", "historical_data"]`
→ **You need to run the schema!** (See below)

### ❌ If it shows: `"connected": false`
→ Environment variables might be wrong. Check Vercel settings.

## Step 2: Run the Database Schema

**You have the `schema.sql` file open - here's how to use it:**

1. **Open Supabase:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/idkuchtgrgooqixdjjcc
   - OR: Vercel Dashboard → Storage → `fis-database` → "Open in Supabase"

2. **Go to SQL Editor:**
   - Click **"SQL Editor"** in left sidebar
   - Click **"New Query"** button

3. **Copy the schema:**
   - In your editor, select ALL text in `database/schema.sql` (Cmd+A)
   - Copy it (Cmd+C)

4. **Paste and run:**
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click **"Run"** button (or press Cmd+Enter)
   - Should see: ✅ "Success. No rows returned"

5. **Verify tables:**
   - Click **"Table Editor"** (left sidebar)
   - You should see 3 tables:
     - `users`
     - `workroom_data`
     - `historical_data`

## Step 3: Check if Data is There

1. **Check Supabase:**
   - Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor
   - Click `workroom_data` table

   - Your data should be there

2. **Check browser console:**
   - Open your app
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Upload a file
   - Look for: "✅ Data saved to database successfully"
