# How to Share Information (I Don't Need Direct Access)

I don't need direct access to your Supabase. Just share information and I can help!

## What to Share

### 1. Browser Console Output
1. Open your app
2. Press **F12** → **Console** tab
3. Upload your data
4. **Copy all messages** (especially errors)
5. Paste them here

### 2. SQL Query Results
1. Run SQL queries I give you
2. Copy the results
3. Share them here

### 3. Screenshots
- Browser console showing errors
- Supabase tables showing data (or empty)
- Any error dialogs

### 4. Error Messages
- Any red error text
- Any error dialogs
- Any failed operation messages

## I Can Help With

✅ **Code fixes** - I can update the code  
✅ **SQL queries** - I can write SQL for you to run  
✅ **Debugging** - I can analyze errors you share  
✅ **Explanations** - I can explain what's happening  

## I Cannot Do

❌ **Direct database access** - I can't connect to your Supabase  
❌ **Run queries for you** - You need to run SQL yourself  
❌ **See your data directly** - Share screenshots/results instead  

## Quick Fix for Your User ID

I've created `database/fix-all-data-to-your-user-id.sql` with your user_id already filled in. Just run it in Supabase SQL Editor!
