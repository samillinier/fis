# 🔄 Redeploy Now - Environment Variables Added!

## ✅ Great! You've added the environment variables.

Now you need to **redeploy** so the variables take effect.

## 🚀 Quick Redeploy Steps:

### Option 1: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

4. **Find** the latest deployment
5. **Click** "..." (three dots) on the right
6. **Click** "Redeploy"
7. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Push a Small Change to Trigger Deploy

I can create a small change and push it to trigger auto-deployment.

2. **Visit:** https://fis-he6w.vercel.app/signin
3. **Click** "Sign in with Microsoft"
4. **Should work now!** ✅

## 🔍 Check Deployment Status:
